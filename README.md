# CacheSimulator
Sarah and Jason's 237 Lab to simulate the motions of a Cache with given inputs

In a cache there is a set. In each set, there are blocks. In this lab, we created a system of blocks, sets, that all fit into the cache. By setting it up like a cache, we entered values and instructed the cache to act on evictions, misses, and hits and in accordance remove and add. When we put a file in of supposed memory to be stored, we recieve the final state and the amount of evictions, misses, and hits that the process went through.
